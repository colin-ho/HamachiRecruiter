[12/03/2025 10:24] it would be nice to have multiple returns out of a UDF without having to use a struct type or returning a pandas / daft table would also be dope.
[12/03/2025 10:40] IDE highlighting is not great when hovering over a UDF in daft. I would like to see the expected inputs that it expects.
[12/03/2025 10:42] `TypeError: 'Series' object is not iterable`
[12/03/2025 10:48] I would like to explode the columns in a struct so it is flat but 'commit.*' does not work
[12/03/2025 11:29] yielding generator from udf that processes data that explodes in volume
[12/03/2025 11:30] udf smarter morsel sizing for udfs that process lots of work per row
[12/03/2025 11:31] rampup on morsel size
[12/03/2025 13:14] set with concurrency on udf itse;f
[12/03/2025 13:14] set morsel size for normal udf = batch size
[12/03/2025 14:10] i would like to concat strings in an agg and specify the delimiter between rows like a newline
[12/03/2025 14:19] this error message is very confusing 'Due to: DaftError::ValueError Cannot run UDF with 0 expression arguments'
[12/03/2025 14:21] turns out the input must be an expression and passing in a string doesn't work. we should give the user a suggestion in that case
[12/03/2025 14:23] this again 'TypeError: 'Series' object is not iterable'
[12/03/2025 14:56] where showing IDE completion for df.where we should put the SQL syntax higher up

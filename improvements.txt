[12/03/2025 10:24] it would be nice to have multiple returns out of a UDF without having to use a struct type or returning a pandas / daft table would also be dope.
[12/03/2025 10:40] IDE highlighting is not great when hovering over a UDF in daft. I would like to see the expected inputs that it expects.
[12/03/2025 10:42] `TypeError: 'Series' object is not iterable`
[12/03/2025 10:48] I would like to explode the columns in a struct so it is flat but 'commit.*' does not work
[12/03/2025 11:29] yielding generator from udf that processes data that explodes in volume
[12/03/2025 11:30] udf smarter morsel sizing for udfs that process lots of work per row
[12/03/2025 11:31] rampup on morsel size
[12/03/2025 13:14] set with concurrency on udf itse;f
[12/03/2025 13:14] set morsel size for normal udf = batch size
[12/03/2025 14:10] i would like to concat strings in an agg and specify the delimiter between rows like a newline
[12/03/2025 14:19] this error message is very confusing 'Due to: DaftError::ValueError Cannot run UDF with 0 expression arguments'
[12/03/2025 14:21] turns out the input must be an expression and passing in a string doesn't work. we should give the user a suggestion in that case
[12/03/2025 14:23] this again 'TypeError: 'Series' object is not iterable'
[12/03/2025 14:53] fuck i hate doing to_pylist for all my udf inputs
[12/03/2025 14:56] where showing IDE completion for df.where we should put the SQL syntax higher up
[12/03/2025 15:06] with column struct.* to expand all while keeping other columns
[12/03/2025 15:08] sammy: we should show some kind of progress bar even if we're on the first morsel. Think slow udf, right now it just shows nothing
[12/03/2025 15:11] sammy: there should be a good way to expand out a single column when doing df show; i have to do to_pylist to see the full content rn
[12/03/2025 15:14] sammy: when using a UDF in local mode, it's unclear that its running with threads - even if you are using batch_size. We should print some kind of warning to let the user know what is going on
[12/03/2025 15:15] sammy: when I use udf.with_concurrency, I dont want to set the number of workers for local. I want it just to be auto
[12/03/2025 15:17] sammy: when using local engine with with_concurrency and there is an error in the udf (like a rate limit) you get the following error BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
[12/03/2025 16:15] colinho: show name of function in progress bar for any udf
[12/03/2025 16:26] colinho: need better api for morsel size
[12/03/2025 16:26] colinho: fix chrome trace dangling
[12/03/2025 16:41] colinho: add distinct on
[12/03/2025 18:01] sammy: we should think about how to expose async udf. when doing the llm inference this gave a massive speed up but is ugly doing an async loop inside
[12/03/2025 22:45] colinho: make swordfish non partitioned writer faster
[13/03/2025 10:34] sammy: Using the list namespace is extremely confusing. I want to just figure out if my list of strings contains a certain string
[13/03/2025 10:36] sammy: when running this sql statement: repo_owner = Eventual-Inc AND repo_name = Daft the error was DaftCoreException: DaftError::FieldNotFound Column Eventual is an outer column but does not have an associated schema. this is really hard to understand what happened
